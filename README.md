## About the Project

This project began as a Milestone-02 project for my Intro to Programming course. The goal was to develop a research question, research plan, and complete it using Python.

### The Question:

What is the utilization of regular health care visits for pediatric patients in the U.S. stratified by health insurance coverage between 2019 and 2023?

### Method:

The data was queried from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Children Summary Statistics. The process and visualization was performed within the Jupyter Notebook. The data span from 2019 to 2023 and was stratified by the health insurance coverage criteria to display their respective estimated percentage of visits utilized.

### Conclusion:

Well child check-up visits steadily declined overall from 2019 to 2021, overlapping with the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2021 to 2023, the estimates returned to 2019 estimates except for Uninsured children. In contrast, estimates for Uninsured children appeared to decrease overall during 2019 to 2023.
